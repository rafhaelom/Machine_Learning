In which, in each sort of arc, there is a monster that a team of hunters has to hunt down. It is a game that is part of the Powered by the Apocalypse system which, if you listen to the Balance arc, is sort of what I based the Stolen Century episodes on. It is a very— it’s sort of like the d20 system, right? That covers a lot of different games, like D&amp;D and Pathfinder. Uh, it is sort of just like a broad rule set that you can put a bunch of different stuff on top of to make it fit whatever genre you want it to fit. And there’s a ton of very cool games that use the Powered by the Apocalypse system. Uh, I was inspired to do an Apocalypse game because of one of my favorite podcasts, Friends at the Table, which has done a bunch of really cool ones in sci-fi worlds and fantasy worlds and all kinds of stuff. But Monster of the Week is sort of this, this monster-of-the-week sort of horror but like, campy horror? Uh, thing that’s going on here? And the basic rule that covers pretty much everything in Monster of the Week and all the Apocalypse games, is that whenever something comes up that is not, like, an automatic thing, like is something that is dangerous or a conflict, or something that would be covered by like a D&amp;D move, like, oh, you have to roll a perception check if you wanna actually notice that thing, all that stuff is in here, but instead of rolling a 20-sided dice, you roll two six-sided dice, and then one of three things happens. Either you roll a six or below, and you have fucked up. You have fucked up now. And something goes horribly wrong sort of at my discretion. I’ll be GMing this game, they actually call the GM in this game The Keeper which is, like, so great to me? That the fiction of the game extends out of the game, like, Stranger Things style. So, six or below is a miss. A seven to nine is a mixed success, where you get to do the thing you wanna do, but usually there is a cost.

       "51771    >The heroes are faster on the draw, leaping into action as the machines turn to engage them.  A wave of photonic fury bleaches the senses, white bathing the open highway, the shine of the mirror-like exterior of the tripod drones causing a harsh glare to reflect back towards the heroes.  The lead drone reels back slightly, the shutter of its eye snapping closed and open again as it tries to correct its visual output.Light is accompanied by sound, as contorts the very air to her wishes, a dull roar accompanying the appearance of a funnel cloud in the midst of the drones.  Those closest to the sudden twister punch the narrow points of their tendrils down into the asphalt, clinging for purchase even as the wind stretches their bodies out to their maximum height with the force of the suction.  One pulls free, pencil-thin tendrils flailing uselessly at the air as it spirals within the funnel and is ultimately ejected upwards and away from the fight.  It crashes into the payload of a lumber truck with a sound not unlike someone dropping a silverware drawer, a wide dent spoiling its simple, futuristic design.As and take to the air, a beam of coherent red light lances out towards them, one of the drones who'd stuck fast to the road shooting at while the throne drone shoots back towards .  The blinking drone fixes its eye on , or, at least the after image of the Korbazi scout, a narrow beam shooting for his center of mass.The other three drones opt against firing, hurling themselves forward and withdrawing their limbs within their spherical bodies as they roll into the fray.  They split up, taking different routes as they try to surround and isolate, but from their aerial position and can see they're clearly moving to encircle .  When they draw close, each suddenly snaps into the air, extending their tendrils and spinning to strike the green-skinned alien with lashing tendrils.At the rear of the fight, Dr. Dendrite struggles, the lengthy limbs that held her aloft having been stuck fast together by 's alien arsenal.  She wobbles awkwardly in place for a moment, lurching forward more by virtue of how many limbs she has to bring to bear rather than any particular grace.  With a sharp SNAKT, she lowers dramatically, segments of her arms having rotated to replace the smooth, ribbon-like quality they'd had with a particularly nasty serrated edge.  The legs move at cross purposes, trying to free themselves from the capture webbing as she moves.  The tip of one tendril snaps open as she approaches the van, a bright white flare of light announcing a laser as she begins cutting through the underside of the vehicle instead of fighting against the advanced locks or armor plating installed in the vehicle itself. \n",
